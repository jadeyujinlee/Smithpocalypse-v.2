# Smithpocalypse-v.2

This is a final project game that is basically a second version of the first Smithpocalypse game in Python. This version is improved upon the first for several reasons. 

1. This version is a text-based game design, whereas the first version took in one character inputs to further the adventure. 
2. Written in Java, this version was an extensive exercise in object-oriented programming. 
3. Employed several high-level data structures, such as HashMaps, a custom Graph, Binary Tree, etc. and used switch cases!
4. Has a "save" file where players can save their progress in real time that updates a text file using a file writer, as well as allows the player to pick up where they last left off if they lose. 
5. Our professors are zombies in this version.
