## COMMANDS AND MAP OF OUR WORLD

## HELPFUL ADVICE
You cannot return to a building once you've completed it, so make sure you take everything you can while you're there! There's no limit on how much you can carry. 

## LIST OF COMMANDS
You can type more than two words, but the extra words will be ignored. For example, you cannot travel to Chapin Lawn by typing "travel to chapin". Instead, type "travel chapin". You could also type "travel chapin lawn". Capitalization is ignored. 

- to travel by foot
  - "walk" or "go", followed by cardinal direction
  - for example, "walk north" or "go w"
- to travel by bike
  - bike must be unlocked
  - "travel", "bike", or "ride" followed by area name
  - for example, "travel burton" or "travel burton hall"
- to check inventory
  - "check", "items", "inventory"
- to use items
  - "use" followed by item name
  - for example, "spray extinguisher" and "use extinguisher" will both work
  - Hint: If you get stuck, try "use". Might not always work, but give it a shot.  
- to take items
  - "take" or "grab", followed by item name
- to leave a building
  - "exit", "leave", or "run away"

Note: some commands only work for specific items. When in doubt, try "use"!

## LIST OF AREAS

The game map is divided into separate areas, each of which can contain buildings you can enter. The available buildings in each area are listed when the player travels there. Here are all the available areas and the words that can be used to access them:

- Burton Lawn (burton)
- Chapin Lawn (chapin)
- Seelye Lawn (seelye)
- The area around College Hall (college, collegehall)
- Green Street (green, greenst, greenstreet)
- The area around Ford Hall (ford) 
- President's House (empty, think of it as a placemark to visualize where you are) 

Three areas along Mill River and College Lane are also available to travel to:
- The upper shore (upper, uppershore)
- The middle shore (middle, middleshore)
- The lower shore (lower, lowershore)

Some areas are actually the borders of the map, and cannot be traveled to, so if the text for these areas show up, go in a different direction. These areas are listed below:
- Elm Street (elm)
- West Street (west)
- Paradise Pond (pond, paradise, lake)

## SAVING AND LOADING 
You can save your progress throughout the game in case you lose at some point. 

to save: 
- "save"

The game also automatically saves your progress every time you use your bike to travel to a new location. 

If you lose, the game takes you back to where you last saved or where you last traveled to with your bike. If you haven't saved or biked anywhere, you will have to restart from the very beginning of the game. 

to load: 
- "load" 

Maybe you forgot where you left off, so the "save.txt" file lists (in this order):
  - what items are in your inventory
  - where you currently are in terms of area and building
  - the remaining items from buildings you might want to pick up
  - how many of the buildings you have completed
  - which abilities you have unlocked
  - which minibosses you have defeated (Hint: The order is "N" and "J")
- You can then play again from where you left off. 

# SPOILER ALERT

There are quite a few challenges in this game and places where you may lose!

Several of the buildings have their own challenges upon entry. We're not going to tell you which, because we really want you to explore and figure stuff out. 

There are two minibosses in this game that you will have to defeat somehow. The hints as to where they are and what tools you need might be on the pieces of paper you pick up throughout the game. 

There is also a final boss you will have to defeat in order to win the game. This final boss situation will be unlocked once you've defeated both minibosses, in addition to the items you unlocked by defeating said minibosses. Do you remember where the posters/flyers/leaflets told you to escape to? At the very beginning? 

Have fun!
